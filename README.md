Learn to create Machine Learning Algorithms in Python and R from two Data Science experts. Code templates included.

This course has been designed by a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning expert so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms, and coding libraries in a simple way.

Over 1 Million students world-wide trust this course.

We will walk you step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. With every tutorial, you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of Data Science.

This course can be completed by either doing either the Python tutorials, or R tutorials, or both - Python & R. Pick the programming language that you need for your career.

This course is fun and exciting, and at the same time, we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

- Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
- Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
- Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
- Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
- Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
- Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
- Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
- Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
- Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost

Each section inside each part is independent. So you can either take the whole course from start to finish or you can jump right into any specific section and learn what you need for your career right now.

Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life case studies. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get lots of hands-on practice building your own models.

And last but not least, this course includes both Python and R code templates which you can download and use on your own projects.

## Setup environment
There is a [.bat file](setup_venv.bat) you can run to:
- Create the virtual environment
- Activate the venv
- Upgrade pip
- Install the [dependencies](requirements.txt)

**Be sure you have the venv activated before running the code.**
